# Swift Protobuf Generator

Generates protobuf definitions from Swift structs. More documentation will come once a proper command line interface is added, right now I'm just developing the initial idea.

## Installing

Protoc and its Swift code generator plugin must both be installed. The following command takes care of both of those things;

```sh
brew install swift-protobuf
```
