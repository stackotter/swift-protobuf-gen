# SwiftProtobufGen

Generates protobuf definitions from Swift structs

## Building

For some reason Xcode builds don't work at all but swiftpm command line builds do.

## Installing

Protoc and its Swift code generator plugin must both be installed. The following command takes care of both of those things;

```sh
brew install swift-protobuf
```
